Steamulate is like the russian roulette of steam games.
It has been designed to enhance your geeky evening with your friends, with a few simple steps:

* Launch the app
* Enter all of the participants' Steam IDs
* Let the fate choose what you'll be suffering with

Basically, the app chooses a game amongst all the games all players have in common.
